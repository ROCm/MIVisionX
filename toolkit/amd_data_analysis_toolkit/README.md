# AMD Data Analysis Toolkit

AMD Data Analysis Toolkit - **ADAT** is a comprehensive set of help tools for neural net creation, development, training, and deployment. The Toolkit provides you with help tools to design, develop, quantize, prune, retrain, and infer your neural network work in any framework. The Toolkit is designed to help you deploy your work to any AMD or 3rd party hardware, from embedded to servers.

MIVisionX provides you with tools for accomplishing your tasks throughout the whole neural net life-cycle, from creating a model to deploying them for your target platforms.

## Image Classification

ADAT - [Image Classification](classification) tool will generate a dynamic analysis toolkit to drill down on image classification results from any neural net model. The tool supports the following features
