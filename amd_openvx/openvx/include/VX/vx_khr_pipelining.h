/*! \brief Sets the graph scheduler config
 *
 * This API is used to set the graph scheduler config to
 * allow user to schedule multiple instances of a graph for execution.
 *
 * For legacy applications that don't need graph pipelining or batch processing,
 * this API need not be used.
 *
 * Using this API, the application specifies the graph schedule mode, as well as
 * queueing parameters for all graph parameters that need to allow enqueueing of references.
 * A single monolithic API is provided instead of discrete APIs, since this allows
 * the implementation to get all information related to scheduling in one shot and
 * then optimize the subsequent graph scheduling based on this information.
 * <b> This API MUST be called before graph verify </b> since
 * in this case it allows implementations the opportunity to optimize resources based on
 * information provided by the application.
 *
 * 'graph_schedule_mode' selects how input and output references are provided to a graph and
 * how the next graph schedule is triggered by an implementation.
 *
 * Below scheduling modes are supported:
 *
 * When graph schedule mode is <tt>\ref VX_GRAPH_SCHEDULE_MODE_QUEUE_AUTO</tt>:
 * - Application needs to explicitly call <tt>\ref vxVerifyGraph</tt> before enqueing data references
 * - Application should not call <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt> or <tt>\ref vxProcessGraph</tt>
 * - When enough references are enqueued at various graph parameters, the implementation
 *   could trigger the next graph schedule.
 * - Here, not all graph parameters need to have enqueued references for a graph schedule to begin.
 *   An implementation is expected to execute the graph as much as possible until a enqueued reference
 *   is not available at which time it will stall the graph until the reference becomes available.
 *   This allows application to schedule a graph even when all parameters references are
 *   not yet available, i.e do a 'late' enqueue. However, exact behaviour is implementation specific.
 *
 * When graph schedule mode is <tt>\ref VX_GRAPH_SCHEDULE_MODE_QUEUE_MANUAL</tt>:
 * - Application needs to explicitly call <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt>
 * - Application should not call <tt>\ref vxProcessGraph</tt>
 * - References for all graph parameters of the graph needs to enqueued before <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt>
 *   is called on the graph else an error is returned by <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt>
 * - Application can enqueue multiple references at the same graph parameter.
 *   When <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt> is called, all enqueued references get processed in a 'batch'.
 * - User can use <tt>\ref vxWaitGraph</tt> to wait for the previous <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt>
 *   to complete.
 *
 * When graph schedule mode is <tt>\ref VX_GRAPH_SCHEDULE_MODE_NORMAL</tt>:
 * - 'graph_parameters_list_size' MUST be 0 and
 * - 'graph_parameters_queue_params_list' MUST be NULL
 * - This mode is equivalent to non-queueing scheduling mode as defined by OpenVX v1.2 and earlier.
 *
 * By default all graphs are in VX_GRAPH_SCHEDULE_MODE_NORMAL mode until this API is called.
 *
 * 'graph_parameters_queue_params_list' allows to specify below information:
 * - For the graph parameter index that is specified, it enables queueing mode of operation
 * - Further it allows the application to specify the list of references that it could later
 *   enqueue at this graph parameter.
 *
 * For graph parameters listed in 'graph_parameters_queue_params_list',
 * application MUST use <tt>\ref vxGraphParameterEnqueueReadyRef</tt> to
 * set references at the graph parameter.  Using other data access API's on
 * these parameters or corresponding data objects will return an error.
 * For graph parameters not listed in 'graph_parameters_queue_params_list'
 * application MUST use the <tt>\ref vxSetGraphParameterByIndex</tt> to set the reference
 * at the graph parameter.  Using other data access API's on these parameters or
 * corresponding data objects will return an error.
 *
 * This API also allows application to provide a list of references which could be later
 * enqueued at the graph parameter. This allows implementation to do meta-data checking
 * up front rather than during each reference enqueue.
 *
 * When this API is called before <tt>\ref vxVerifyGraph</tt>, the 'refs_list' field
 * can be NULL, if the reference handles are not available yet at the application.
 * However 'refs_list_size' MUST always be specified by the application.
 * Application can call <tt>\ref vxSetGraphScheduleConfig</tt> again after verify graph
 * with all parameters remaining the same except with 'refs_list' field providing
 * the list of references that can be enqueued at the graph parameter.

/*! \brief Start streaming mode of graph execution
 *
 * In streaming mode of graph execution, once an application starts graph execution
 * further intervention of the application is not needed to re-schedule a graph;
 * i.e. a graph re-schedules itself and executes continuously until streaming mode of execution is stopped.
 *
 * When this API is called, the framework schedules the graph via <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt> and
 * returns.
 * This graph gets re-scheduled continuously until <tt>\ref vxStopGraphStreaming</tt> is called by the user
 * or any of the graph nodes return error during execution.
 *
 * The graph MUST be verified via \ref vxVerifyGraph before calling this API.
 * Also user application MUST ensure no previous executions of the graph are scheduled before calling this API.
 *
 * After streaming mode of a graph has been started, a <tt>\ref vxScheduleGraph</tt> should **not** be used on that
 * graph by an application.
 *
 * <tt>\ref vxWaitGraph</tt> can be used as before to wait for all pending graph executions
 * to complete.
 *
 * \param graph [in] Reference to the graph to start streaming mode of execution.
 *
 * \return A <tt>\ref vx_status_e</tt> enumeration.
