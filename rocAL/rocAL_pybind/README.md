# rocAL Python Binding

rocAL Python Binding allows you to call functions and pass data from Python to rocAL C/C++ libraries,
letting you take advantage of the rocAL functionality in both languages.

rocal_pybind.so is a wrapper library that bridge python and C/C++, so that a rocAL functionality
written primarily in C/C++ language can be used effectively in Python.
