# rocAL Performance Tests with Depth
This application can be used to run performance tests on rocAL graphs with depth greater than 1.
This is very similar to the rocAL Performance Tests app except it takes an extra parameter to specify depth.

## Build Instructions

* ROCm Performance Primitives (RPP)
