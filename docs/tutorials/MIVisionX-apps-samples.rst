MIVisionX sample applications
******************************************

Several examples applications are available for use with MIVisionX.

The applications in the `apps directory <https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/tree/develop/apps>`_ illustrate how the MIVisionX libraries can be used to develop products.

The samples in the `samples directory <https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/tree/develop/samples>`_ can be used to learn how to use the MIVisionX libraries.

Utilities that can be used to develop, prototype, and test sample applications are available from the `MIVisionX GitHub repository <https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/tree/develop/utilities>`_:

* `mv_deploy <https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/tree/develop/utilities/mv_deploy>`_ is a utility that uses the model compiler to create and build applications.

* `RunVX <https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/tree/develop/utilities/runvx>`_ is a command-line tool that runs OpenVX graphs.
