MIVisionX includes the `AMD data analysis toolkit (ADAT) <https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/tree/develop/toolkit/amd_data_analysis_toolkit>`_ and the `AMD data generation toolkit (ADGT) <https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/tree/develop/toolkit/amd_data_generation_toolkit>`_ 

ADAT is a set of neural network tools that help design, develop, quantize, prune, retrain, and infer a neural network in any framework.  The ADAT image and object classification tools can be used to analyze the results of image classification and object returned by any neural net model.

ADGT's Classification Label Generator Toolkit (CLG-Toolset) creates a classification label validation list for a given image database and label set. It is used for renaming the dataset, resizing the images, and extracting metadata.
