# AMD OpenVX (amd_openvx)
AMD OpenVX is a highly optimized open source implementation of the [Khronos OpenVX](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vx/) computer vision specification. It allows for rapid prototyping as well as fast execution on a wide range of computer hardware, including small embedded x86 CPUs and large workstation discrete GPUs.

The amd_openvx project consists of the following components:
* [OpenVX](openvx/README.md): AMD OpenVX library

The OpenVX framework provides a mechanism to add new vision functions to OpenVX by 3rd party vendors. Look into amd_openvx_extensions for additional OpenVX modules and utilities.

* **vx_loomsl**: Radeon LOOM stitching library for live 360 degree video applications
* **vx_nn**: OpenVX neural network module that was built on top of [MIOpen](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen)
* **vx_opencv**: OpenVX module that implemented a mechanism to access OpenCV functionality as OpenVX kernels

This software is provided under an MIT-style license,  see the file COPYRIGHT.txt for details.

## Features
* The code is highly optimized for both x86 CPU and OpenCL for GPU
* Supported hardware spans the range from low power embedded APUs (like the new G series) to laptop, desktop and workstation graphics
* Supports `Windows`, `Linux`, and `OS X`
* Includes a “graph optimizer” that looks at the entire processing pipeline and removes/replaces/merges functions to improve performance and minimize bandwidth at runtime 
* Scripting support allows for rapid prototyping, without re-compiling at production performance levels

## Pre-requisites
* CPU: SSE4.1 or above CPU, 64-bit.
* GPU: Radeon Professional Graphics Cards or Vega Family of Products (16GB required for vx_loomsl and vx_nn libraries)
  * Windows: install the latest drivers and OpenCL SDK [download](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases)
  * Linux: install [ROCm](https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html)
* OpenCV 3.4+ [download](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases) for RunVX & AMD OpenCV Extensions
  * Set OpenCV_DIR environment variable to OpenCV/build folder

## Build Instructions
Build this project to generate AMD OpenVX library and RunVX executable. 
* Refer to [openvx/include/VX](openvx/include/VX) for Khronos OpenVX standard header files.
* Refer to [openvx/include/vx_ext_amd.h](openvx/include/vx_ext_amd.h) for vendor extensions in AMD OpenVX library.
* Refer to [runvx/README.md](../utilities/runvx/README.md) for RunVX details. 
* Refer to [runcl/README.md](../utilities/runcl/README.md) for RunCL details. 

### Build using `Visual Studio 2017` on 64-bit `Windows 10`
* Install OpenCV with/without contrib [download](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases) for RunVX tool to support camera capture and image display (optional)
 * OpenCV_DIR environment variable should point to OpenCV/build folder
* Use amd_openvx/amd_openvx.sln to build for x64 platform
* If AMD GPU (or OpenCL) is not available, set build flag ENABLE_OPENCL=0 in openvx/openvx.vcxproj and runvx/runvx.vcxproj.

### Build using CMake
* Install CMake 2.8 or newer [download](http://cmake.org/download/).
* Install OpenCV with/without contrib [download](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases) for RunVX tool to support camera capture and image display (optional)
 * OpenCV_DIR environment variable should point to OpenCV/build folder
* Install libssl-dev on linux (optional)
* Use CMake to configure and generate Makefile
* If AMD GPU (or OpenCL) is not available, use build flag -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_OpenCL=TRUE.
