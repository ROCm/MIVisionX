MIVisionX has utility applications which could be used by developers to test, quick prototype or develop sample applications.

## [RunCL](runcl#amd-runcl)
RunCL is a command-line tool to build, execute, and debug OpenCL programs, with a simple, easy-to-use interface.

## [RunVX](runvx#amd-runvx)
RunVX is a command-line tool to execute OpenVX graphs, with a simple, easy-to-use interface. It encapsulates most of the routine OpenVX calls, thus speeding up development and enabling rapid prototyping. As input, RunVX takes a GDF (Graph Description Format) file, a simple and intuitive syntax to describe the various data, nodes, and their dependencies. The tool has other useful features, such as, file read/write, data compares, image and keypoint data visualization, etc.
