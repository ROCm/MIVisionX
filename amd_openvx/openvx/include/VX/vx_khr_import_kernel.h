 * \param type [in] Vendor-specific identifier that indicates to the implementation
 *   how to interpret the url. For example, if an implementation can interpret the url
 *   as a file, a folder a symbolic label, or a pointer, then a vendor may choose
 *   to use "vx_<vendor>_file", "vx_<vendor>_folder", "vx_<vendor>_label", and
 *   "vx_<vendor>_pointer", respectively for this field. Container types starting
 *   with "vx_khr_" are reserved. Refer to vendor documentation for list of
 *   container types supported
 * \param url [in] URL to binary container.
 *
 * \retval On success, a valid vx_kernel object. Calling vxGetStatus with the return value
 *   as a parameter will return VX_SUCCESS if the function was successful.
