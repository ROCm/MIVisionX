## Applications

MIVisionX has several [applications](apps/README.md#applications) built on top of OpenVX modules, it uses AMD optimized libraries to build applications that can be used to prototype or use as a model to develop products.

![MIVisionX Applications](images/MIVisionX-applications.png)

* [Bubble Pop](apps/bubble_pop/README.md#vx-bubble-pop-sample): This sample application creates bubbles and donuts to pop using OpenVX & OpenCV functionality.
* [Cloud Inference Application](apps/cloud_inference/README.md#cloud-inference-application): This sample application does inference using a client-server system.
* [Digit Test](apps/dg_test/README.md): This sample application is used to recognize hand written digits.
* [Image Augmentation](apps/image_augmentation/README.md#image-augmentation-application): This sample application demonstrates the basic usage of rocAL's C API to load JPEG images from the disk and modify them in different possible ways and displays the output images.
* [MIVisionX Inference Analyzer](apps/mivisionx_inference_analyzer/README.md#mivisionx-python-inference-analyzer): This sample application uses pre-trained `ONNX` / `NNEF` / `Caffe` models to analyze and summarize images.
* [MIVisionX OpenVX Classification](apps/mivisionx-openvx-classifier/README.md): This sample application shows how to run supported pre-trained caffe models with MIVisionX RunTime.
* [MIVisionX Validation Tool](apps/mivisionx_validation_tool/README.md#mivisionx-python-ml-model-validation-tool): This sample application uses pre-trained `ONNX` / `NNEF` / `Caffe` models to analyze, summarize and validate models.
* [MIVisionX WinML Classification](apps/README.md#mivisionx-winml-classification): This sample application shows how to run supported ONNX models with MIVisionX RunTime on Windows.
* [MIVisionX WinML YoloV2](apps/README.md#mivisionx-winml-yolov2): This sample application shows how to run tiny yolov2(20 classes) with MIVisionX RunTime on Windows.
* [Optical Flow](apps/optical_flow/README.md#openvx-samples): This sample application creates an OpenVX graph to run Optical Flow on a video/live.
* [External Applications](apps/README.md#external-application)
