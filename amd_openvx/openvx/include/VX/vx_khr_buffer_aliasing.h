 * that only saves memory but otherwise doesn't give a performance improvement.  For example, a kernel which performs
 * sparse processing may need to first do a buffer copy before processing if the buffers are not aliased. However a kernel
 * which performs dense processing will not need to do this.  So priority of the alias request may be given to the
 * kernel which performs sparse processing.
