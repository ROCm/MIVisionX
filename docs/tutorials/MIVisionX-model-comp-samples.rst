MIVisionX model compiler samples
******************************************

The sample applications available in `samples/model_compiler_samples <https://github.com/ROCm/MIVisionX/blob/master/samples/model_compiler_samples/README.md>`_, demonstrate how to run inference efficiently using AMD's open source implementation of OpenVX and OpenVX extensions. The samples review each step required to convert a pre-trained neural net model into an OpenVX graph and run this graph efficiently on the target hardware.
