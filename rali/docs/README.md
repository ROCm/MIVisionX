# RALI Introduction
Today’s deep learning applications require loading and pre-processing data efficiently to achieve high processing throughput.  This requires creating efficient processing pipelines fully utilizing the underlying hardware capabilities. Some examples are load and decode data, do a variety of augmentations, color-format conversions, etc. 
Deep learning frameworks require supporting multiple data formats and augmentations to adapt to a variety of data-sets and models.

AMD Radeon Augmentation Library (RALI) is designed to efficiently do such processing pipelines from both images and video as well as from a variety of storage formats.  
These pipelines are programmable by the user using both C++ and Python APIs. 

## Key Components of RALI
*    Full processing pipeline support for data_loading, meta-data loading, augmentations, and data-format conversions for training and inference.
*    Being able to do processing on CPU or Radeon GPU (with OpenCL or HIP backend) 
*    Ease of integration with framework plugins in Python
*    Support variety of augmentation operations through AMD’s Radeon Performance Primitives (RPP).
*    All available public and open-sourced under ROCm.

## Prerequisites
Refer to the [RALI](../README.md) to follow and install pre-requisites.

## Build instructions
Follow the build instructions in [RALI](../README.md)

## RALI Python
*   RALI Python package has been created using Pybind11 which enables data transfer between RALI C++ API and Python API.
*   Module imports are made similar to other data loaders like NVidia's DALI.
*   rali_pybind package has both PyTorch and TensorFlow framework support.
*   Various reader format support including FileReader, COCOReader, and TFRecordReader.
*   example folder contains sample implementations for each reader variation as well as sample training script for PyTorch
*   RALI is integrated into MLPerf Resnet-50 Pytorch classification example on the ImageNet dataset.

## RALI Python API

### amd.rali.ops

### amd.rali.pipeline 
* Contains Pipeline class which has all the data needed to build and run the RALI graph.
* Contains support for context/graph creation, verify and run the graph.
* Has data transfer functions to exchange data between frameworks and RALI
* define_graph functionality has been implemented to add nodes to build a pipeline graph.

### amd.rali.types
Rali.types are enums exported from C++ API to python. Some examples include CPU, GPU, FLOAT, FLOAT16, RGB, GRAY, etc..

### amd.rali.plugin.pytorch
*  Contains RaliGenericIterator for Pytorch.
*  RaliClassificationIterator class implements iterator for image classification and return images with corresponding labels.
*  From the above classes, any hybrid iterator pipeline can be created by adding augmentations.
*  see example [PyTorch Simple Example](./examples). Requires PyTorch.

### installing RALI python plugin (Python 3.6)
*  Build and install RPP
*  Build and install MIVisionX which installs rali c++ lib
*  Go to [rali_pybind](../rali_pybind) folder
*  sudo ./run.sh

### Steps to run MLPerf Resnet50 classification training with RALI on a system with MI50 and ROCm
